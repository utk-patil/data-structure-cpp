### Array, Pointers and Structures
Array is a linear data structure used to store a collection of elements. Here are some common operations and examples.

1. Program to input values into an array and display them. [ğŸ”—](Array/basic.cpp)
2. Program to find the maximum and minimum number in an array. [ğŸ”—](Array/min_max.cpp)
3. Program to reverse the elements of an array. [ğŸ”—](Array/reverse.cpp)
4. Program to pass array elements to a function. [ğŸ”—](Array/array_elements_to_function.cpp)
5. Program to pass an array to a function. [ğŸ”—](Array/array_to_function.cpp)
6. Program to input and display matrix. [ğŸ”—](Array/matrix.cpp)
7. Program for addition of two matrices.  [ğŸ”—](Array/matrices_addition.cpp)
8. Program for multiplication of two matrices. [ğŸ”—](Array/matrices_multiplication.cpp)
9. Program to dereference pointer variables. [ğŸ”—](Array/dereference_pointer.cpp)
10. Program to understand pointer to pointer. [ğŸ”—](Array/pointer_to_pointer.cpp)
11. Program to print the value and address of the elements of an array. [ğŸ”—](Array/array_elements_address.cpp)
12. Program to print the value and address of elements of an array using pointer notation. [ğŸ”—](Array/array_elements_address_using_pointer.cpp)
13. Call by value. [ğŸ”—](Array/call_by_value.cpp)
14. Call by reference. [ğŸ”—](Array/call_by_reference.cpp)
15. Program to show how to return more than one value from a function using call by reference. [ğŸ”—](Array/return_multiple_value_function.cpp)
16. Program to show a function that returns pointer. [ğŸ”—](Array/return_pointer_function.cpp)
17. Program to show that chages to the array made inside the function affect the original array. [ğŸ”—](Array/change_array_to_function.cpp)
18. When an array is passed to a fuynction, the receiving argument is declared as a pointer. [ğŸ”—](Array/array_passed_function_receiving_arg.cpp)
19. Array of pointers. [ğŸ”—](Array/array_of_pointers.cpp)
20. Program to understand dynamic allocation of memory. [ğŸ”—](Array/dynamic_memory_allocation.cpp)
21. Program to understand the use of realloc() function. [ğŸ”—](Array/realloc.cpp)
22. Program to display the values of structure members. [ğŸ”—](Array/structure.cpp)
23. Program to assign a structure variable to another structure variable. [ğŸ”—](Array/assign_structure_variable.cpp)
24. Program to understand array of structures. [ğŸ”—](Array/structure_array.cpp)
25. Program to understand arrays within structures. [ğŸ”—](Array/array_within_structure.cpp)

27. Program to understand how structure memebers are sent to a function. [ğŸ”—](Array/pointer_member_as_arg.cpp)
28. Program to understand how a strcture variable is sent to an function. [ğŸ”—](Array/structure_variable_as_arg.cpp)
29. Program to understand how a pointer to structure variable is sent to a function. [ğŸ”—](Array/pointer_to_structure_as_arg.cpp)
30. Program to understand how a pointer to structure is returned from a function. [ğŸ”—](Array/return_pointer_structure_from_function.cpp)
31. Program to understand how a structure varibale is returned from a function. [ğŸ”—](Array/return_structure_from_function.cpp)
32. Program to understand how an array of structures is sent to a function. [ğŸ”—](Array/array_structure_as_arg.cpp)

### Linked Lists
A linked list is a dynamic data structure used to store a sequence of elements, with each element pointing to the next. This section includes implementations for different types of linked lists.

1. Program of single linked list. [ğŸ”—](LinkedList/single_linked_list.cpp)
2. Program of double linked list [ğŸ”—](LinkedList/double_linked_list.cpp)

---

### Stacks and Queues
Stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure commonly used for recursion and function call management.<br><br>
Queue is a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure, ideal for scenarios like task scheduling.

1. Program of stack using array. [ğŸ”—](StacksQueues/stack.cpp)
2. Program of stack using linked list. [ğŸ”—](StacksQueues/stack_using_linked_list.cpp)
3. Program of queue using array. [ğŸ”—](StacksQueues/queues.cpp)
4. Program of queue using linked list. [ğŸ”—](StacksQueues/queue_using_linked_list.cpp)

### Searching and Hashing
Searching involves finding an element, while hashing enables quick data access using keys.

1. Sequencial or Linear search in an array. [ğŸ”—](SearchingHashing/linear_search.cpp)
2. Sentinel sequencial search in an array. [ğŸ”—](SearchingHashing/sentinel_linear_search.cpp)
