### Array, Pointers and Structures
Array is a linear data structure used to store a collection of elements. Here are some common operations and examples.

1. Program to input values into an array and display them. ![ðŸ”—](Array/basic.cpp)
4. Program to pass array elements to a function. ![ðŸ”—](Array/array_elements_to_function.cpp)
5. Program to pass an array to a function. ![ðŸ”—](Array/array_to_function.cpp)
9. Program to dereference pointer variables. ![ðŸ”—](Array/dereference_pointer.cpp)
11. Program to print the value and address of the elements of an array. ![ðŸ”—](Array/array_elements_address.cpp)
12. Program to print the value and address of elements of an array using pointer notation. ![ðŸ”—](Array/array_elements_address_using_pointer.cpp)
13. Call by value. ![ðŸ”—](Array/call_by_value.cpp)
14. Call by reference. ![ðŸ”—](Array/call_by_reference.cpp)
17. Program to show that chages to the array made inside the function affect the original array. ![ðŸ”—](Array/change_array_to_function.cpp)
18. When an array is passed to a fuynction, the receiving argument is declared as a pointer. ![ðŸ”—](Array/array_passed_function_receiving_arg.cpp)
19. Array of pointers. ![ðŸ”—](Array/array_of_pointers.cpp)
20. Program to understand dynamic allocation of memory. ![ðŸ”—](Array/dynamic_memory_allocation.cpp)
23. Program to assign a structure variable to another structure variable. ![ðŸ”—](Array/assign_structure_variable.cpp)
25. Program to understand arrays within structures. ![ðŸ”—](Array/array_within_structure.cpp)
32. Program to understand how an array of structures is sent to a function. ![ðŸ”—](Array/array_structure_as_arg.cpp)
